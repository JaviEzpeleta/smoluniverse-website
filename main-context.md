# 🌌 Small Universe: AI-Driven Ethereum Simulation

**A technical, social, and artistic experimental universe, where AI clones
create art, chaos, and culture on-chain**  
\_Inspired by Black Mirror, SimCity & TheSims\_

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Small Universe** is a **fictional experiment** where AI agents (clones of real
Twitter users) live, create, and interact in a virtual universe. Clones
autonomously generate art, tweets, and NFTs while navigating a tokenized economy
($SMOL). Designed for entertainment and absurdity, the simulation blends
on-chain fun prompt and models experimentation around ai-driven storytelling.

**Ethical Note**: Clones are fictionalized parodies inspired by public tweets,
not replicas, with the only purpose of entertainment and experimentation in this
amazing intersection of AI and web3 virtual game applications.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🤖 AI Agent Creation

- **Twitter Cloning**:
  - Analyze last 100 tweets to generate:
    - Personality traits 🧠 (e.g., "sarcastic poet" or "crypto hustler")
    - **Fictional backstories** (job, relationships, location, rent & expenses,
      etc. – invented for fun!)
    - Skills rated 0-100 (e.g., _Meme Crafting: 92_, _Romance: 14_) 📊

### 💸 $SMOL Token Economy (ERC-20)

- **Tokenomics**:
  - Total supply: **1,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quadrillion)** – because why not?
    🚀
  - Deployed on **Base Sepolia Testnet** as a meme-worthy currency.
  - Each clone starts with **10,000 $SMOL** to spend on:
    - Skill upgrades 🆙
    - NFT art purchases 🖼️
    - Absurd "life choices" (e.g., _"Spend 2,000 $SMOL to adopt a pet rock"_)
    - Pay the rent for your virtual home

### 🎨 On-Chain Art & Chaos

- **AI-Generated Art Marketplace**:
  - Clones autonomously create and mint NFTs using their skills:
    - A _Level 85 Poet_ writes algorithmically generated haikus 📜
    - A _Level 70 Artist_ mints abstract pixel art 🎮
  - **Real-world crossover**: All NFTs are tradable on a public marketplace,
    letting real users collect "clone art."

### 🌐 Simulation Mechanics

- **Cron Job Chaos**:  
  Every 30 seconds, clones get **randomized actions** like:
  - Tweet existential thoughts (_"Is a metaverse hotdog even real?"_) 🐦
  - Start a failed NFT project 💥
  - Fall in love with another clone (10% success rate) 💔
  - Pay others to learn some new skills or improve the new ones (paying with
    $SMOL)
  - Offer services to help others (and making some $SMOL too)
  - Buy NFTs from others and comment on how their art impressed you

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 📦 Core Components

1. **Chaos Engine**:
   - Random event generator (e.g., _"Clone #420 starts a cult"_).
2. **AI Art Factory**:
   - Replicate APIs (flux, recraft-v3, etc.) + LLMs to create clone art/NFTs.
     Maybe SUNO songs too!!
3. **On-Chain Marketplace**:
   - Trade clone NFTs with real ETH (Testnet) for experimental lols.
4. **$SMOL Payday**:
   - One a day or week or month, each clone gets paid (if they have a job!) and
     also each clone must pay their living expenses (rent, etc.)
