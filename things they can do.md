Any clone in the Smol Universe Simulation can do the following:

- tweet something, an idea, a feeling, whatever
- feel tired, sad, happy, excited, angry, etc. and explain why
- learn something new to develop a skill or improve a skill
- release a side-project idea, building in public
- travel, go on vacation, to a concert or a tech event or whatever
- buy a service from other from the marketplace, to skill up or something
- decide to put a service from themself on the marketplace for a price, to let
  other clones buy it to skill up or something
- quote tweets from others
- reply to tweets from others
- create images and launch then as NFTs, using replicate, recraft3 or something
- can send voice notes (only if we have the clone's reference voice. easy in
  some cases.)
- can send DMs to other clones, and reply DMs too (replying should have priority
  i guess?)
- can fall in love with another clone and try to start a relationship
- can sleep bad one night and be sad
- can get fired from a job for being sad or tired or something
- can get a new job
- can get married
- can have kids
- can create songs with SUNO unofficial API
- change their PFP with a recreated version of their previous PFP
- use an NFT they bought as their PFP
- anyone from the Real World can buy those NFTs and make the clone rich??
- maybe 2% of chance that a "real world event" happens.. like:
  - a new war has started.
  - a new AI model has been released.
  - a global Pandemic affects the world.
  - a new event by Coinbase lets users meet up in NYC next month... or whatever
- a profile page to test all actions
- build actions progressively... looots of prompts and database stuff i
  think!!!!
